    Attributes
    ----------
    wave_functions : numpy array
        The wave functions of the propagating modes.
    momenta : numpy array
        Momenta of the modes.
    velocities : numpy array
        Velocities of the modes.
    block_nmodes: list of integers
        Number of left or right moving propagating modes
        per conservation law block of the Hamiltonian.

    Notes
    =====
    The sort order of all the three arrays is identical. The first half of the
    modes have negative velocity, the second half have positive velocity.
    Within these halves the modes are ordered by the eigenvalues of any
    declared conservation laws. Within blocks with the same conservation law
    eigenvalue the modes with negative velocity are ordered by increasing
    momentum, and the modes with positive velocity are ordered by decreasing
    momentum. Finally, modes are ordered by the magnitude of their velocity.
    To summarize, the modes are ordered according to the key
    `(sign(v), conserved_quantity, sign(v) * k , abs(v))` where `v` is
    velocity, `k` is momentum and `conserved_quantity` is the conservation
    law eigenvalue.

    In the above, the positive velocity and momentum directions are defined
    with respect to the translational symmetry direction of the system.

    The first dimension of `wave_functions` corresponds to the orbitals of all
    the sites in a unit cell, the second one to the number of the mode.  Each
    mode is normalized to carry unit current. If several modes have the same
    momentum and velocity, an arbitrary orthonormal basis in the subspace of
    these modes is chosen.

    If a conservation law is specified to block diagonalize the Hamiltonian
    to N blocks, then `block_nmodes[i]` is the number of left or right moving
    propagating modes in conservation law block `i`. The ordering of blocks
    is the same as the ordering of the projectors used to block diagonalize
    the Hamiltonian.

class StabilizedModes:
    """Stabilized eigendecomposition of the translation operator.

    Due to the lack of Hermiticity of the translation operator, its
    eigendecomposition is frequently poorly conditioned. Solvers in Kwant use
    this stabilized decomposition of the propagating and evanescent modes in
    the leads. If the hopping between the unit cells of an infinite system is
    invertible, the translation eigenproblem is written in the basis `psi_n,
    h_hop^+ * psi_(n+1)`, with ``h_hop`` the hopping between unit cells.  If
    `h_hop` is not invertible, and has the singular value decomposition `u s
    v^+`, then the eigenproblem is written in the basis `sqrt(s) v^+ psi_n,
    sqrt(s) u^+ psi_(n+1)`. In this basis we calculate the eigenvectors of the
    propagating modes, and the Schur vectors (an orthogonal basis) in the space
    of evanescent modes.

    `vecs` and `vecslmbdainv` are the first and the second halves of the wave
    functions.  The first `nmodes` are eigenmodes moving in the negative
    direction (hence they are incoming into the system in Kwant convention),
    the second `nmodes` are eigenmodes moving in the positive direction. The
    remaining modes are the Schur vectors of the modes evanescent in the
    positive direction. Propagating modes with the same eigenvalue are
    orthogonalized, and all the propagating modes are normalized to carry unit
    current. Finally the `sqrt_hop` attribute is `v sqrt(s)`.

        Hamiltonian isn't invertible. The second element set to `True` forces

    Parameters
    ----------
    h_cell : numpy array, real or complex, shape (N,N) The unit cell
        Hamiltonian of the lead unit cell.
    h_hop : numpy array, real or complex, shape (N,M)
        The hopping matrix from a lead cell to the one on which self-energy
        has to be calculated (and any other hopping in the same direction).
    tol : float
        Numbers and differences are considered zero when they are smaller
        than `tol` times the machine precision.
    stabilization : sequence of 2 booleans or None
        Which steps of the eigenvalue prolem stabilization to perform. If the
        value is `None`, then Kwant chooses the fastest (and least stable)
        algorithm that is expected to be sufficient.  For any other value,
        Kwant forms the eigenvalue problem in the basis of the hopping singular
        values.  The first element set to `True` forces Kwant to add an
        anti-Hermitian term to the cell Hamiltonian before inverting. If it is
        set to `False`, the extra term will only be added if the cell
        Hamiltonian isn't invertible. The second element set to `True` forces
        Kwant to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem, and not to reduce it
        to the regular one.  If it is `False`, reduction to a regular problem
        is performed if possible.  Selecting the stabilization manually is
        mostly necessary for testing purposes.
    particle_hole : sparse or dense square matrix
        The unitary part of the particle-hole symmetry operator.
    time_reversal : sparse or dense square matrix
        The unitary part of the time-reversal symmetry operator.
    chiral : sparse or dense square matrix
        The chiral symmetry operator.
    projectors : an iterable of sparse or dense matrices
        Projectors that block diagonalize the Hamiltonian in accordance
        with a conservation law.

    Returns
    -------
    propagating : `~kwant.physics.PropagatingModes`
        Contains the array of the wave functions of propagating modes, their
        momenta, and their velocities. It can be used to identify the gauge in
        which the scattering problem is solved.
    stabilized : `~kwant.physics.StabilizedModes`
        A basis of propagating and evanescent modes used by the solvers.

    Notes
    -----
    The sorting of the propagating modes is fully described in the
    documentation for `~kwant.physics.PropagatingModes`.  In simple cases where
    bands do not cross, this ordering corresponds to "lowest modes first". In
    general, however, it is necessary to examine the band structure --
    something this function is not doing by design.

    Propagating modes with the same momentum are orthogonalized. All the
    propagating modes are normalized by current.

    This function uses the most stable and efficient algorithm for calculating
    the mode decomposition that the Kwant authors are aware about. Its details
    are to be published.
