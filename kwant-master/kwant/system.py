        The system graph.

        If provided, encodes ranges of sites that have the same number of
        orbitals. Each triple consists of ``(first_site, norbs, orb_offset)``:
        the first site in the range, the number of orbitals on each site in the
        range, and the offset of the first orbital of the first site in the
        range.  In addition, the final triple should have the form
        ``(len(graph.num_nodes), 0, tot_norbs)`` where ``tot_norbs`` is the
        total number of orbitals in the system.
    parameters : frozenset of strings
        The names of the parameters on which the system depends. This attribute

    Notes
    -----
    The sites of the system are indexed by integers ranging from 0 to
    ``self.graph.num_nodes - 1``.

    Optionally, a class derived from ``System`` can provide a method ``pos`` which
    is assumed to return the real-space position of a site given its index.

    Due to the ordering semantics of sequences, and the fact that a given
    ``first_site`` can only appear *at most once* in ``site_ranges``,
    ``site_ranges`` is ordered according to ``first_site``.

    Consecutive elements in ``site_ranges`` are not required to have different
    numbers of orbitals.

    Attributes
    ----------
    leads : sequence of leads
        Each lead has to provide a method ``selfenergy`` that has
        the same signature as `InfiniteSystem.selfenergy` (without the
        ``self`` parameter), and must have property ``parameters``:
        a collection of strings that name the system parameters (
        though this requirement is provisional and may be removed in
        a future version of Kwant).
        It may also provide ``modes`` that has the
        same signature as `InfiniteSystem.modes` (without the ``self``
        parameter).
    lead_interfaces : sequence of sequences of integers
        Each sub-sequence contains the indices of the system sites
        to which the lead is connected.
    lead_paddings : sequence of sequences of integers
        Each sub-sequence contains the indices of the system sites
        that belong to the lead, and therefore have the same onsite as the lead
        sites, and are connected by the same hoppings as the lead sites.
    parameters : frozenset of strings
        The names of the parameters on which the system depends. This does
        not include the parameters for any leads. This attribute
        is provisional and may be changed in a future version of Kwant

    Notes
    -----
    The length of ``leads`` must be equal to the length of ``lead_interfaces``
    and ``lead_paddings``.

    For lead ``n``, the method leads[n].selfenergy must return a square matrix
    whose size is ``sum(len(self.hamiltonian(site, site)) for site in
    self.lead_interfaces[n])``. The output of ``leads[n].modes`` has to be a
    tuple of `~kwant.physics.PropagatingModes`, `~kwant.physics.StabilizedModes`.

    Often, the elements of `leads` will be instances of `InfiniteSystem`.  If
    this is the case for lead ``n``, the sites ``lead_interfaces[n]`` match
    the first ``len(lead_interfaces[n])`` sites of the InfiniteSystem.

        The number of sites in a single cell of the system.

    Notes
    -----
    The system graph of an infinite systems contains a single cell, as well as
    the part of the previous cell which is connected to it.  The first
    `cell_size` sites form one complete single cell.  The remaining ``N`` sites
    of the graph (``N`` equals ``graph.num_nodes - cell_size``) belong to the
    previous cell.  They are included so that hoppings between cells can be
    represented.  The N sites of the previous cell correspond to the first
    ``N`` sites of the fully included cell.  When an ``InfiniteSystem`` is used
    as a lead, ``N`` acts also as the number of interface sites to which it
    must be connected.

    The drawing shows three cells of an infinite system.  Each cell consists
    of three sites.  Numbers denote sites which are included into the system
    graph.  Stars denote sites which are not included.  Hoppings are included
    in the graph if and only if they occur between two sites which are part of
    the graph::
